# 01-Accessibility-

## Description

This Accessibility page contains HTML code written in accessible semantic format. Through working on this project I learned how to make code that is inclusive, and easy for anyone to follow.  As well as construct a style sheet that is concise where it can be, and well commented to explain each selector and classes use. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![Accessbility page](./Assets/accessibility-screenshot.png)
