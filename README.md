# 01-Accessibility-

## Description

This Accessibility page contains HTML code written in accessible semantic format. Through working on this project I learned how to make code that is inclusive, and easy for anyone to follow.  As well as construct a style sheet that is concise where it can be, and well commented to explain each selector and classes use.
